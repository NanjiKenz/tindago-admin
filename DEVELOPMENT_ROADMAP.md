npx tsc --noEmit   # Should be clean âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ My Recommendation: Start with Store Management

**Why Store Management First:**
1. **Business Critical** - Core revenue process
2. **High User Impact** - Directly affects store owners
3. **Data Rich** - Lots of Firebase integration practice
4. **Visual Impact** - Document uploads, approvals very satisfying to build

**Next Steps:**
1. **Build document preview modal** for store registrations
2. **Add approval workflow** with admin comments
3. **Implement notification system** for store owners
4. **Create bulk approval** for multiple stores
