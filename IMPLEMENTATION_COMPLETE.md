# ✅ Implementation Complete - Payment System

## What Was Built

You now have a **complete, production-ready centralized payment system** for TindaGo!

## 🎯 System Overview

### **Centralized Platform Model** ✅
- ✅ Single Xendit account for entire platform (tindago-admin)
- ✅ Automatic commission calculation and deduction
- ✅ Store earnings tracked in Firebase ledger
- ✅ No Xendit account needed for stores
- ✅ Industry-standard architecture (like Shopee, Grab, Uber)

### **Why This Is The Best Approach**
1. **Simpler** - Stores don't manage payment credentials
2. **Secure** - Sensitive keys stay server-side only

## 🔄 Payment Flow

```
Customer → Mobile App → tindago-admin → Xendit → Customer pays
                            ↓
                      Updates Firebase
                            ↓
              ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
              ↓                           ↓
    Order Status = "paid"      Ledger + Wallet Updated
              ↓                           ↓
    Customer notified           Store can see earnings
```

## 💰 Commission System

### Priority Order
```
1. Store Custom Rate (if set)
   ↓
2. Global Rate (Firebase)
   ↓
3. Environment Default (0.01)
```

### Example
```
Order: ₱500
Commission (1%): ₱5
Store Gets: ₱495

Platform commission stays in Xendit account
Store earnings tracked in Firebase ledger
```
