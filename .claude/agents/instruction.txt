Complex Request:

@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code

I need help with this Figma admin design:
https://www.figma.com/design/8I1Nr3vQZllDDknSevstvH/TindaGo-Admin?node-id=102-456

It's an admin dashboard with:
- Store registration approval cards
- Filter and search functionality
- Status indicators and action buttons
- Integration with Firebase database

Please create the Next.js components with AdminService integration.

Error Handling Example:

@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code

I'm getting this error when implementing your previous solution:

ERROR: Module not found: @/lib/adminService
at AdminDashboard.tsx:15

The dashboard should show store registrations with approve/reject buttons.
Can you fix this and update the component?

Follow-up Work:

@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code

Can you add real-time updates to the admin dashboard you created earlier?
I need:
- Live store registration notifications
- Auto-refresh when data changes
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling for Firebase failures

ðŸš€ Pro Tips

For Best Results:

1. Always include Figma URL when converting admin designs
2. Describe the admin functionality (store management, user admin, etc.)
3. Mention any Firebase integration needed
4. Paste full error messages when you encounter issues
5. Reference previous admin work the agent did for you

The Agent Will:

- âœ… Extract Figma data automatically
- âœ… Download all required assets to public/images/
- âœ… Create pixel-perfect Next.js admin components
- âœ… Integrate with existing AdminService and Firebase
- âœ… Follow TindaGo admin patterns and authentication
- âœ… Learn from any errors you share

Just @mention the agent and describe what admin functionality you need. It has all our established admin patterns and will learn from anything new you encounter.

Focus: This agent is for ADMIN DASHBOARDS to manage the TindaGo React Native app, not for creating TindaGo app features on web.
