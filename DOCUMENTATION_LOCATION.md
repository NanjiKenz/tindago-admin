# Documentation Location

All project documentation has been moved outside the codebase to reduce storage usage.

## Location
The documentation is now located at:
```
C:\CapsProj\tindago-admin-Documentation
```

## Structure
- **fixes/** - Bug fixes, hotfixes, and issue resolutions
- **guides/** - How-to guides, testing guides, and references
- **implementations/** - Implementation reports and summaries
- **setup/** - Setup and configuration guides

## Why Moved?
The markdown documentation files in the root directory were consuming storage in the codebase. Moving them outside keeps the repository lean while preserving all documentation.

## Access
You can access the documentation by navigating to the parent directory:
```bash
cd ../tindago-admin-Documentation
```

Or open it directly in your file explorer:
```
C:\CapsProj\tindago-admin-Documentation
```
