- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

### Custom Scripts
- `npm run figma:sync` - Sync design tokens and assets from Figma
- `npm run figma:watch` - Watch for Figma design changes

### Database Migration Scripts
- `npm run migrate:usertype` - Migrate user types from old format to customer format
- `npm run migrate:usertype:dry-run` - Preview migration changes without applying them
- `npm run migrate:usertype:backup` - Create backup of user data before migration
- `npm run migrate:usertype:rollback` - Rollback migration if needed
- `npm run standardize:status` - Standardize status fields across database collections
- `npm run standardize:status:check` - Check status field inconsistencies without applying changes

## Development Workflow

### Admin Dashboard Development
1. **Adding New Features**: Extend AdminService with new Firebase operations
2. **UI Components**: Use existing clean UI components from `src/components/ui/`
3. **State Management**: Use AuthContext for authentication state and React patterns for data fetching
4. **Error Handling**: Implement user-friendly error messages using useNotifications hook
5. **Authentication**: Leverage middleware.ts for route protection and AuthContext for state
6. **Figma Integration**: Use TindaGo Web Design-to-Code Agent for converting admin designs

### TindaGo Web Admin Design-to-Code Agent Integration

**Primary Agent for Admin Dashboard Development:**
Use the `tindago-web-admin-design-to-code` agent for ALL Figma admin design conversions. This specialized agent masters exact TindaGo admin patterns and Firebase integration.

**Usage Examples:**

Simple Activation:
```
@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code

Convert this Figma admin dashboard design to Next.js:
https://www.figma.com/design/8I1Nr3vQZllDDknSevstvH/TindaGo-Admin?node-id=102-123

This is the store registration management dashboard for TindaGo Admin.
```

Complex Request with Firebase Integration:
```
@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code

I need this Figma admin design with full functionality:
https://www.figma.com/design/8I1Nr3vQZllDDknSevstvH/TindaGo-Admin?node-id=102-456

Features needed:
- Store registration approval cards with real-time updates
- Filter and search functionality
- Status indicators and action buttons
- Integration with AdminService and Firebase database
```

**Agent Capabilities:**
- âœ… Extracts Figma data automatically using `mcp__figma-developer-mcp__get_figma_data`
- âœ… **Smart asset management**: Checks for existing assets in `public/images/shared/` before downloading duplicates
- âœ… Downloads new assets to organized directories (`public/images/admin/`, `public/images/shared/`)
- âœ… Creates pixel-perfect Next.js admin components with 1440px baseline
- âœ… Integrates with existing AdminService and Firebase patterns
- âœ… Follows established TindaGo admin authentication and routing
- âœ… Uses exact Tailwind CSS classes and TindaGo design tokens
- âœ… Implements desktop-first responsive design for admin interfaces

**Pro Tips:**
1. Always include complete Figma URL with node-id when requesting conversions
2. Describe specific admin functionality needed (user management, store approval, etc.)
3. Mention Firebase integration requirements for real-time data operations
4. Reference existing admin components for consistency
5. The agent learns from previous work and maintains design system consistency

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Personal Figma access token for design sync (optional)
- Firebase configuration handled in `src/lib/firebase.js` for Realtime Database
- Firebase project configuration requires Realtime Database service enabled

### Business Requirements Focus
This admin dashboard specifically addresses:

**Focus: Comprehensive Admin Management System**
- **Store Management** - Registration review, approval workflow, status management
- **User Management** - Admins, customers, store owners with role-based access
- **Financial Operations** - Transaction monitoring, wallet management, payout approvals
- **Payment Integration** - Xendit payment gateway with real-time synchronization
- **Document Verification** - Business permits, valid IDs, compliance tracking

  configId: string;
  storeId?: string;  // null for default rate
  category?: string; // category-specific rate
  commissionRate: number;
  effectiveFrom: string;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

## Important Conventions

### Import Paths & TypeScript
- Use `@/` path alias for src imports: `import { AdminService } from '@/lib/adminService'`
- Path aliases configured in `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript mode
- Maintain clean import structure with barrel exports (`index.ts` files)

### Styling & Component Patterns
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility-first approach with custom TindaGo theme
- **Design System**: Use Tailwind CSS classes with TindaGo theme tokens
- **Responsive Design**: Use responsive scaling functions (s, vs, ms) for Figma-based components
- **Component Architecture**: Follow established patterns in existing UI components

### Firebase & Data Management
- **Async/Await**: Consistent patterns for Firebase Realtime Database operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement user-friendly error messages with proper try/catch blocks
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Firebase listeners for live data synchronization
- **Data Validation**: Validate Firebase data structures match TypeScript interfaces

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All new code must include proper type definitions
- **ESLint**: Follow Next.js ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- **Component Documentation**: Include Figma node IDs and coordinate comments for design system components

## MCP Figma Integration Setup

### Figma MCP Server Configuration
The project uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for Figma integration:

**MCP Settings** (`mcp-settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=figd_Qow2KUHJ6s6vuXbduOs9Wj001_5mg7m8XNFCTnmN", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Permissions** (`.claude/settings.local.json`):
- `mcp__figma-developer-mcp__get_figma_data` - Extract Figma design data
- `mcp__figma-developer-mcp__download_figma_images` - Download assets automatically

### Admin Dashboard Design System
- **Baseline**: 1440x1024px desktop-first design for admin interfaces
- **Typography**: Clash Grotesk Variable and Inter fonts
- **Component Library**: Specialized admin components in `src/components/admin/`

### Optimized Asset Management Strategy
**Organized Structure** (avoid duplicating existing assets):
```
public/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                    # Reusable assets across pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/                # Common UI icons (user, settings, search, plus, edit, delete)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logos/                # TindaGo brand assets (tindago-logo.svg/png)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ badges/               # External badges (app-store, google-play)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/                    # Admin-specific assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/stats-icons/  # Dashboard stat card icons
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sidebar/              # Navigation icons
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ profile/              # User profile assets
â””â”€â”€ landing/features/         # Landing page specific assets
```

**Asset Usage Guidelines:**
- âœ… **Check existing assets first**: Use `public/images/shared/icons/` for common icons
- âœ… **Reuse shared assets**: Reference same icon across multiple components
- âœ… **Avoid duplicates**: Copy existing assets to new locations rather than re-downloading
- âœ… **Use organized paths**: `<img src="/images/shared/icons/user-icon.png" />`
- âœ… **TindaGo logo**: Always use `/images/shared/logos/tindago-logo.svg` for consistency

### Figma Integration Workflow
1. Use `@tindago-web-admin-design-to-code` agent for admin design conversions
2. Provide Figma URL with specific node-id for targeted component extraction
3. Agent automatically extracts design data and downloads all assets
4. Creates pixel-perfect Next.js components with Firebase integration
